# Orchestrator state (read this first after any context compaction)

Updated: 2026-11-07, generation 2 starting (scope v2).

## Read first, every time
1. lab/SCOPE.md (authoritative scope, Sam confirmed) 2. lab/NORTH-STAR.md (five priorities, fixed) 3. lab/TARGETS.md (measurements,
requirements, 20 golden scenarios) 4. lab/PLAN.md v2 5. this file 6. lab/SCORECARD.md 7. lab/NOTEBOOK.md tail.
Never use old targets: 256 req/s load bar, 10m/100m as a target, 256/512/1024 load acceptance, exact int64.

## Environment facts
- Repo /Users/sam/projects/triplex-db-2 (git, main). Harness on main: lab/bin/engine.mjs, gate.mjs, receipt.mjs, status.mjs, heavy.mjs.
- Docker: colima `triplex2` (6 CPU/12 GiB/60 GiB); ALWAYS DOCKER_HOST=unix:///Users/sam/.colima/triplex2/docker.sock; after any
  colima command run `docker context use colima`. Dev engines: tx2-xtdb-dev :5470, tx2-qlever-dev :7070. Slots s1-s3.
- pnpm: always `--store-dir /Users/sam/projects/triplex-db-2/.pnpm-store`; never `pnpm config set` (it rewrote pnpm-workspace.yaml once).
- Agents: research Sonnet xhigh; coding and verifiers Opus high (commander's intent + North star + Scope lines); adversarial review
  Codex gpt-6.1-sol xhigh (session 01a1b72e-26d6-77a1-ac09-6ab8c3b10d43 holds plan and contract history).
- Subagent harness refuses REPORT.md writes: agents return reports as text; the orchestrator saves them.
- Hourly cron ae766d26 (:07): learnings pass; reread NORTH-STAR first.
